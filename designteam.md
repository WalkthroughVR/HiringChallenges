# Walkthrough Design Challenge
Welcome to the Walkthrough Design Challenge. At Walkthrough, you’ll be leading the design charge and will be asked for your point of view, reasoning, and thought process throughout the entire implementation of the project. This is your chance to show the team how you approach problems and give us insight into your abilities. For the challenge, you are required to think through the design process of one of our applications. You will have 72 hours to submit a solution for the given requirements. Please read all the instructions carefully and email us (pascal@getawalkthrough.com) if you have any questions.


## The Why
At this point, we love you as a candidate and we're really trying to access what makes _you_ different over the other candidates we like. How well do you know your stuff? How detailed are you? Do we feel really strongly in having you _lead_ our design efforts. Remember, we're non-designers hiring you. **Help us feel that we'd be in good hands with you.**


## Getting Started
Let’s pretend tomorrow you were hired for the lead UX/UI role at Walkthrough. One of your first projects is to build an mobile app for photographers to reduce error, improve consistency, and increase photographer retention. 

Write a procedure you would follow including: 
- Assessing the problem to product deployment
- Why are you completing each step
	- Example: Interview 30 users to create a user persona - I’m interviewing 30 customers because it allows me to get a good enough sample size without needing to spend days interviewing users. The persona’s then allow me to evaluate “Does the design work for this user” and also gives me the specific people I should test the end product with. 

## Evaluation Criteria
- How thorough are you in your design process?
- Why are you performing each action in your process? Are you performing parts because it’s what is expected or do you really understand the “why” behind each step in your procedure.
- Do you consult an engineering team and if so, when?
- How do you evaluate yourself as a good designer. What metrics do you use?
- Are you more UX, UI, or Front-End oriented?
    - UX Designer might be focused more around users testing with wireframes
    - UI Designer might be more focused on how does the user “feel” on specific pages or throughout the experience as a whole
    - A Front-End Designer might be more focused on testing and implementation

## Examples 
#### Procedure

1. Establish the problem, hypothesis, metrics, risks, assumptions, stakeholders.
2. Interview 3+ users who currently use the product. Questions we'd ask are:
	- Whats your name, age, gender, etc?
	- What are you trying to achieve?
	- What frustrates you about our current system?
3. Create user personas for each user including (Example: http://i64.tinypic.com/2dwdvdt.png)



#### Reasoning

1. Before starting any project. I really need to outline the exact problem we're solving, have an existing starting point with metrics to understand if in the end we've made any improvement, and mark down my own hypothesis and assumptions. 
2. I chose 3 users because I need to get a basic understanding of what the users care about but don't want to hold up the process of design where I may already know the main issues at hand.  In terms of the questions I'm asking, I'm really trying to dig into XYZ. 
3. Here is an exact template I use to put together user personas. I think it's important to include Psychographic information and not just Demographic information because XYZ.
